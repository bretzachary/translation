problem with getting two-gram count: it includes fluff like 'de la'
so to filter: the naive bayes trick from scikit tutorial. alternatively, just filter manually selected words. can the trick identify words 'most associated' with article. or most important words across articles?



ideas:
next to article highlight noteworthy vocab (unique, common, etc)
same as above - with definitions at top of articles. sort of a 'what to expect' section.


to do:
clean up article page
category/section page
category/section subsections on front page
accounts - articles read, vocab_stuff,  ?(achievements)
