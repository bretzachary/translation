think about katerra
read about them in an article on crunchbase
then learned about them in article from nytimes

so maybe theres value in a platform that links to all things sobre company X.
crunchbase kinda has this at the bottom for their company profile pages.
hmm..
maybe more like a search engine/platform for news. but then google has a news search function
so maybe get people's preferences and be their platform for the news or whatver on their favorite topics.

i could implement this myself if i get more thorough with tags. then recommend things

index for news
best sources, reputable sources etc
just links


to do:

subtitles on various pages. if no subtitle (maybe that means if subtitle = ''), leave empty
	index
	article
	section
	

for the hidden menu logo icon for small screens:
	instead of 'hide' can it be removed?

form for entering docs: permission = superuser


changes made in 2:
	Article model fields (a few changes here) + def save
		problems migrating? comment out contents of ngrams file
	Form
	Add_Article view, Add_Image view
	tempate(add_article.html, add_image.html)
	urls
	
	!commented out the following from article_page_with_paywall, twice:
		#context_dict['vocab'] = views_bit(article)

	'add_art_and_img' view and html
	added captions to article_page_redesign_template
	
	removed 'translated_text' from 'exclude' field of forms.py

periodically run a (is it a routine? - cron job? celery task?) that will update the '_800_most_common_words.txt' file and also populate each articlewords model with correct most_common_words-field data. again, so that it is not computed on the fly as is currently done with the 'views bit' function and can instead just be a model query.

in the new environment. with new technology. the world we live in today. would traditional news look how it does now if it were just invented? of course not. so let's help it adapt to new environment. legacy news is just that - legacy.

maybe make totally free.
you need an invite to join. one invite per person.
ask for sponsorships/donations. i can embed ads. donations go to hosting, articles.
active email to participate.
need to re-up the email to make sure it is active. and can solicit more donations from there.
maybe for each 'membership', a kid gets a 'membership' too.

this article exactly
http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/02/new-york-times-subscription-revenue-is-mixed-news-for-media.html

what does it mean to be a content aggregator? platform. classpass? spotify?
collectivize subscriptions?
	person A buys NYT, person B WSJ
	they share articles. subscritions are 'grouped'
	maybe enforce that each user has a subcription to *a* publication
	remit payments to publishers proportional to articles read
	or if they 'pay' then that money goes into a pool that pays publishers

survey/get reader info when signup (where from. howlong studying? are they a regular reader of any of papers (this last point can be used to drive value. especially on the 'learn english' site. englisht that is translated back to them.ie, readers who otherwise would not read these sources -spanish readers etc.))

ideas:
maybe categoriza vcab by importance (frequency)
same as above - with definitions at top of articles. sort of a 'what to expect' section.

profile(account)page:
recommended articles (even if 'not enough data')
recently read articles

don't forget about a/b testing
harvard business review articles
blogs <- might be easiest ppl to reach out to (for licensing)

Hey, I'm actually a Spanish language learner but one thing that I've found a ton of success with is to read everyday in Spanish. I read the (american) news avidly and so I started to translate (online) my everyday reading into Spanish to kill two birds with one stone. Did this for about a month and saw how much it worked so I went and created this: readroom.org.

My thing was that I had little motivation for reading native spanish articles/news - I just couldn't get myself interested in the content that I was turning up. Just by regularly reading for about 15-20 each day I've noticed a huge improvement, especially in my vocab. 

I'm just reaching out to you guys to see if there's any interest in doing the same for french. It wouldn't take much effort for me to make a french 'version', but I wouldn't bother if there's no interest.

Oh, I should point out that when you login, you get the ability to hover over text to see the original english (for times when you get stuck on a word or encounter tricky grammar).
